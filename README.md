# SimpleLogin

## Overview

SimpleLogin is an Android application that provides a basic implementation of a login system. This project is designed to help developers understand the fundamental components involved in creating a simple, functional login screen using Android Studio. The application is structured following modern Android development practices, including the use of Kotlin, AndroidX libraries, and proper resource management.

## Features

- **User Login Screen**: A simple UI for user authentication.
- **Validation**: Basic input validation for username and password fields.
- **Navigation**: Displays appropriate toast messages based on user actions, such as successful login or invalid credentials.
- **Error Handling**: Displays toast messages for various error scenarios, such as empty fields or incorrect login details.
- **Usage of Data Classes**: hashCode() method is used to hash the user objects
- **Usage of elvis (?:) operator**: null pointer execeptions are handled using the elvis operator
- **Making UI components Visible/Invisible**: Buttons have been made invisible/visible for relevant operations

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Android project structure:

- **`app/`**: Contains the main application source code and resources.
  - **`src/`**
    - **`main/`**
      - **`java/`**: Contains the Kotlin source code.
      - **`res/`**: Contains the resources like layouts, strings, and drawables.
      - **`AndroidManifest.xml`**: The manifest file that describes essential information about the app.
    - **`androidTest/`**: Contains instrumentation tests.
    - **`test/`**: Contains unit tests.
  - **`build.gradle.kts`**: The Gradle build file for the app module.
  - **`proguard-rules.pro`**: ProGuard configuration file for code obfuscation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Android Studio**: Make sure you have the latest version installed.
- **Gradle**: The project uses Gradle for build automation, so ensure that your environment is set up accordingly.
- **Kotlin**: The project is written in Kotlin, so familiarity with Kotlin is recommended.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio:
   - Use `File > Open` and select the `SimpleLogin` directory.

3. Sync the project with Gradle files:
   - Android Studio should automatically prompt you to sync, or you can do it manually via `File > Sync Project with Gradle Files`.

4. Build and run the project:
   - Select a device or emulator and run the project using the `Run` button in Android Studio.

## Usage

- Launch the app on your device or emulator.
- Enter the username and password to log in. (You can set up predefined credentials in the code for testing purposes.)
- The application will display toast messages based on the action performed:
  - **Successful Login**: Displays a toast indicating successful login.
  - **Invalid Credentials**: Displays a toast with an error message if the credentials are incorrect.
  - **Empty Fields**: Displays a toast prompting the user to fill in the required fields.

## Customization

- **UI Modifications**: Modify the XML layout files in the `res/layout/` directory to change the look and feel of the login screen.
- **Authentication Logic**: Modify the Kotlin files in the `java/` directory to implement custom authentication logic or integrate with a backend service.
